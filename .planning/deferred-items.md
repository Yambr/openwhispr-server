# Deferred Items — OPEN ONLY

Items discovered during execution that are still actionable. Closed items
are archived under `.planning/backlog-archive/`.

**Triage convention:** any item below is OPEN. When a fix lands, delete
the entry rather than marking it closed — git history preserves the
record. Keep this file under ~200 lines.

**Bug count: 0.** Every entry below is a planning/feature/debt item,
not a bug. The Phase 53 fix wave (May 18-19, 2026) closed every
identified production defect. What's left needs scoping decisions
(coverage closure phase, MSW intercept architecture), not fixes.

## Coverage debt

### COVERAGE-debt — root vitest workspace Branches coverage 89.31% (lifetime; threshold-passing)

Current `pnpm test` at repo root:
- Statements 95.38% ✅
- Branches  **89.31%** ⚠️ (threshold 80%, target 90%)
- Functions 95.81% ✅
- Lines     96.22% ✅

Threshold-passing. The CLAUDE.md ≥90/90/90/90 rule is **per-phase
on diff**, not lifetime total — lifetime 89.31% is debt, NOT a
blocker. This entry stays open to track the gap, but it's not a
bug; closure requires a coverage-closure phase.

**Progress this session** (2026-05-19):
- Excluded `**/__tests__/**` from coverage (drops phantom branches
  in test-fixture `setup.ts` files).
- Excluded `apps/worker/src/index.ts` (boot wiring, mirrors api).
- Added `packages/data/tests/unit/__tests__/oauth-state-codec.test.ts`
  — 12 cases, covers all hasAllSidecars branches + provider chain.
- Added 5 better-auth-handler URL-fallback tests.
- Added 3 resolveLocalesDir tests.
- Net: 88.12% → 89.31% (+1.19%).

**Remaining gap to 90%:** ~22 covered branches. Highest-leverage
files (per `coverage/coverage-summary.json` sorted by uncovered
desc): `better-auth-handler.ts` (28), `messages.ts` (9),
`ConversationDetailClient.tsx` (9), `agent/stream.ts` (8), several
route `list.ts` (~4-7 each). Most need integration tests
(testcontainers Postgres) or DB-touching route stubs.

**Plan of attack:** open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` after a
fresh `pnpm test`, sort by Uncovered Branches desc, file targeted
plans for the top 10 files. Each per-file fix is <50 LOC of vitest,
but the totals require ~10 PRs to close.

## Phase 54+ ownership

### FEATURE-msw-intercept — server-side fetch intercept (MSW node-server)

24 e2e specs in `apps/web/tests/e2e/` are auto-skipped under the slim
topology because their `page.route()` stubs can't intercept the
RSC server-side fetch wall. Phase 54 should land MSW node-server to
intercept inside the Next.js server runtime; would re-enable the
24 currently-skipped loading/error state specs.

## Historical (pre-Phase 53)

Older items from Phases 14, 18, 20, 31, 33, 51 live in
`.planning/backlog-archive/deferred-items-2026-05-19-archive.md`. Most
are either:
- Closed but not removed when the fix landed
- Subsumed by later phase work
- Still open but cold (no signal in 30+ days)

If a cold item resurfaces (test failure, prod alert, audit hit),
promote it back into this file with current date + repro.
